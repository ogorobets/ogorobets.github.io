=================

1. Make a program for guessing a number

- when user rejected entering a number (esc, cancel)
- when user entered incorrect number (i.e. number entered wasn't in specified range)
- when user didn't guess a number
- when user guessed correct number

	It isn't necessarily for correct answer to change after program restart
	Request data from user has to be done using `prompt(str)`, where `str` - message text of the popup. Convert string to number using `parseInt(str, 10)`.

2. Set such values of variable `b` that will correspond to the correct answers written in comments of logical expressions

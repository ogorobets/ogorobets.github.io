Task description
================

Create widget "stopwatch". Buttons "stop", "start" (the same button), "reset", "lap". The stopwatch is running to within milliseconds. When stopwatch is running it shows time in format hh:mm:ss:ms. If preceding time digits are zeros don't display them. Pressing button "stop" stops the stopwatch. Buttons "lap" adds current stopwatch time to the list of results. Elements from the list of results can be deleted separately. Button "reset" stops the stopwatch if it's running. And then it remove all results if there are any.

Control from keyboard (check working in different keyboard layouts): s - start/stop, l - lap, r - reset. It can be more than one stopwatch on the page. That stopwatch controls from the keyboard above which mouse pointer was the last time.
